This is a test project to illustrate the Hyperbolic geometry, one of the two types of Non-Euclidean geometries.

The project uses the library freeglut.

----------------------------------
To compile the project(Linux), make sure you've installed the glu library
    sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev
then run
    make
the program shall be generated in the bin/ directory of the name Geometry

----------------------------------
To cross-compile the project for Windows on a Linux machine, install MinGW by entering
    sudo apt-get install mingw32
then run
    make -f Makefile.mingw32_cross
the program shall be generated in the bin_win/ directory of the name Geometry.exe

----------------------------------
To compile the project in Windows, make sure you've installed MinGW(included in DEV-C++), then run
    make -f Makefile.mingw32
or
    mingw32-make -f Makefile.mingw32
the program shall be generated in the bin_win/ directory of the name Geometry.exe
